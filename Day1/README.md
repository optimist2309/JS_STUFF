What is Javascript ?
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

We can add JavaScript to a web application in two ways:

    1.Inline JavaScript: Writing JavaScript code directly within the HTML file, inside <script></script> tags.

    2.External JavaScript: Creating a separate script.js file and linking it in the HTML file using <script src="script.js"></script>.
